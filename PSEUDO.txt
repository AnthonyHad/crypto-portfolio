EXTRA
# What do I want to do?
# I want to create the top 10 ranked cryptocoins in our db
  # What to I need for that?
    # name, open, close, high, low, volume and market cap
# First I need to get the IDs to be able to make the OHLC call
# Once I have the IDs I can store them (This only needs to happen once)
# 4969 coins. Do I only want to call only the top 10 at the beggining or
# do I want it to be more dynamic?
# What happens if you want to make an investment of a non-top 10 coin?
# Can we make a functionality that calls the API for the IDs and checks if there
# is a coin that doesn´t already exist. Then it will only pull the general info
# of the new coins and create them (general info and market info)
# We can only display top 10 coins. So we would need to constantly update the top 10 rank
# And we would also have to update the market info daily. That way we have the latest
# Market data for all coins, and the user can use it.
# We would need to include a search functionality for the coins when the user
# is going to create an investment
